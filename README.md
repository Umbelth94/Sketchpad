# Sketchpad
Sketchpad based on the Odin Project

In this project, I made a basic etch-a-sketch webpage using basic CSS, HTML, and Javascript in an exercise to learn DOM Manipulation.  Admittedly, it was a struggle, and as I started to pack in more features it became very clear that I could have built this in a smarter, cleaner way.  However, even though the code looks like spaghetti, I am going to keep it as it is instead of refactoring, as a monument to my ignorance that I can look back on in the future and see how far I've come.  

Some features I am proud of: 
-The Color Copying Feature
-The Color Save feature that lets you build your own pallet of colors
-Pixel Border fade
-Creative use of buttons to create "toggled" on/off effects for the different features.

Some features I intend on adding in the future, if I ever come back to this project: 
-3 different selectable canvas size options (not resolution, but actual size of the canvas on the screen)
-Toggleable color themes for the web page itself
-Feature to change the background color of the canvas 

Note:The Copy Color Feature lets you turn your stylus into whatever color pixel that you click on.
     The Save Color Feature saves the most recent color used and saves it for use later in the bottom section of the web page.
     
Overall, I learned a lot with this project through trial and error.  I definitely learned a lot of ways NOT to do things, and how taking the time to really think about how I'm going to structure the basic building blocks of the project will save me a lot of headaches than if I were to just brute force my way through different features and additions (like I did).  

I hope you enjoy tinkering around with what I've built here, as I am quite proud of it.  I also hope you enjoy looking through my javascript and trying to figure out if I actually knew what I was doing or not.  (I was fine, mostly).

Thanks,

Travis
