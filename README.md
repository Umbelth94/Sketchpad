# Sketchpad
Sketchpad based on the Odin Project

In this project, I will be attempting to create a web page that allows you to create a grid and draw over it using the mouse,
allowing the pixels on the grid to change color.  I am basing this project off of the Odin Project's assignment linked here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch.

The goal of this project is to get more experience using javascript for DOM manipulation.  

I plan on adding some extra features above and beyond what the Odin Project's assignment asks for, such as a button to change the colors of the pixels that are moused over.
