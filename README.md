## Description
Sketchpad based on the Odin Project

In this project, I made a basic etch-a-sketch webpage using CSS, HTML, and Javascript in an exercise to learn DOM Manipulation.  Admittedly, it was a struggle, and as I started to pack in more features it became very clear that I could have built this in a smarter, cleaner way.  However, even though the code looks like spaghetti, I am going to keep it as it is instead of refactoring, as a monument to my ignorance that I can look back on in the future and see how far I've come.  

## Usage and Features
- Simply click on the canvas to start drawing!  Hold shift + click to remove pixels.
- Change colors with the color swatch, or go crazy and let the rainbow ink do your coloring for you.  The colors will be completely random, but will not overwrite colors that are already placed unless you hit the Rainbow Overwrite toggle.
- Black Ink is self explanatory.  
- Copy Color will allow you to change the brush to whatever color you click on next.  
- Save Color will allow you to save whatever color you currently have selected to a menu on the bottom, where they can then be selected accordingly.  
- Shading will gradually darken the pixels as you repeatedly draw over them.  
- Hide Pixel Borders will get rid of the grid lines so you can see your masterpiece in all it's glory.

## Future Plans
- I would like to revisit this when I understand more about CSS so that I can make this more mobile-friendly (AKA even remotely viewable on mobile);
- There are some minor tweaks I would like to add to make the flexbox sizing play nicer on smaller screens
- Toggleable buttons to change the color theme of the page itself
- Ability to change the default background color of the canvas instead of just white.
- Ability to save drawings as images.

## Reflection
Some features I am proud of: 
- The Color Copying Feature
- The Color Save feature that lets you build your own pallet of colors
- Pixel Border fade
- Creative use of buttons to create "toggled" on/off effects for the different features.

Things I learned:
- Using Javascript to toggle HTML elements "on/off" with different CSS stylings
- Converting hex codes from the color swatch into RGBA values in order to allow the capability for the shading feature.
- Creating a custom slider and event listener for it to update the grid.
- How to manipulate and change the colors of empty DIV containers (and then add a LOT of conditions to make sure all the features I added play nice together)
     
Overall, I learned a lot with this project through trial and error.  I definitely learned a lot of ways NOT to do things, and how taking the time to really think about how I'm going to structure the basic building blocks of the project will save me a lot of headaches than if I were to just brute force my way through different features and additions (which is exactly what I did).  

I hope you enjoy tinkering around with what I've built here, as I am quite proud of it.  I also hope you enjoy looking through my javascript and trying to figure out if I actually knew what I was doing or not.  (I was fine, mostly).

Thanks,
